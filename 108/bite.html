<p>In this Bite you calculate the total amount of points earned with Ninja Belts by accessing the given <code>ninja_belts</code> dict.</p><p>You learn how to access <i>score</i> and <i>ninjas</i> (= amount of belt owners) from no less than a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" target="_blank"><code>namedtuple</code></a> (if you're new to them, check out the basic <code>Point</code> example in the docs).</p><p>Why a namedtuple, you did not even mention a tuple yet?!</p><p>Good point, well in our Bites we might actually <a href="https://codechalleng.es/bites/search/namedtuple/">use them even more</a> so let's get to know them here (if you have a free evening read up on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html" target="_blank"><code>collections</code> module</a> as well and thank us later).</p><p>The function returns the total score <code>int</code>. You learn to write generic code because we test for an updated <code>ninja_belts</code> dict as well, see the TESTS tab.</p>
